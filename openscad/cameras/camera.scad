* This is part of the OpenFlexure microscope, an open-source      *
* microscope and 3-axis translation stage.  It gets really good   *
* precision over a ~10mm range, by using plastic flexure          *
* mechanisms.                                                     *
*                                                                 *
* This file defines the camera mount module, as well as two       *
* functions that return the height of the module and the position *
* of the sensor within that module.  It picks between the various *
* supported cameras using the "camera" variable.                  *
*                                                                 *
