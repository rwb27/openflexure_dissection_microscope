# Openflexure Dissection Microscope

This is a (currently pretty basic) frame that lets a Raspberry Pi camera module function as a dissection/inspection/soldering microscope.  It pinches a lot of code from the [OpenFlexure Microscope](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/).

You can download the STL files from the [STL folder](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_dissection_microscope/tree/master/stl) and get the [assembly instructions](./docubricks/) online.  The full project source is in the [github repository](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_dissection_microscope/).
